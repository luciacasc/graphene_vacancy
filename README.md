# graphene_vacancy
Study of magnetism induced by vacancies in graphene.
Spin-polarized density functional theory has been used to study the effects
of vacancy defects on the magnetic properties of a graphene sheet. 
In this project, it is used Quantum ESPRESSO. 
See the file 'README.pdf' for more details.
